# Resource

Test model reads the first character from `resources/y.txt` during initialization and applies its integer value to `y`.

The plot shows the [reference result](Resource_ref.csv) computed with [simulate_fmi3_me.c](https://github.com/modelica/Reference-FMUs/blob/master/examples/simulate_fmi3_me.c).
